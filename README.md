# About Teahouse

Teahouse is a small library that helps you write clients for the [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) decentralized message protocol.

See [docs/README.md] for more information. (For a nicer view of the docs including inline code samples, do `npm i && npm run serve-docs` to get a docsify rendering.)
