# About Teahouse

Teahouse is a small library that helps you write clients for the [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) decentralized message protocol.

Nostr is relatively new protocol and network designed to create decentralized, resilient applications based on compact "events" passed between clients and one or more relays. The [basic specification](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md) is a quick read, and implementations are only required to implement a few basic operations (mainly hashing + signing JSON payloads according to the canonical form specific in NIP-01.
