# teahouse todo

in no particular order...

- [x] fix network mocks for tests (it's hard to trust when it's so fragile)
- [ ] cache for profiles + messages
    - [ ] localstorage instead of idb? (simpler, maps directly to files + other k/v backends)
    - [ ] add edit log, push that for sync
- [ ] local filter matching
